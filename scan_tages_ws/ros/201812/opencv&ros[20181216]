在使用robot_vison时一直显示
```
rosrun robot_vision cv_bridge_test.py
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named cv_bridge_test.py below /home/kevin/workSpace/opencvRos_ws/src/robot_vision
[rosrun] Found the following, but they're either not files,
[rosrun] or not executable:
[rosrun]   /home/kevin/workSpace/opencvRos_ws/src/robot_vision/scripts/cv_bridge_test.py

```
原因是没有讲python授权为可执行文件
```
sudo chmod +x ./cv_bridge_test.py
```
